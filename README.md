Deliverable #3

## Analysis Overview: 

Visuals created in Tableau were used to present a bike-sharing business opportunity in Des Moines, Iowa to potential investors. These visuals were based on relevant data obtained from an existing bike share program in New York. The purpose of this proposal is to assist potential investors in evaluating the viability of the bike-sharing business opportunity and determining whether it is worth pursuing.

## Summary: 

The visualizations offer a broad overview of potential customers in Des Moines, based on New York data that identifies bike usage by gender, subscriber status, non-subscriber status, and peak rental days and times. While the visuals are a useful starting point, gathering additional data on factors such as weather, income levels, age groups, tourism patterns, and community classifications (such as urban, suburban, and rural) would be necessary for potential investors to make a more informed decision about the risks and opportunities associated with a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.
